# Procedurez
Universal iOS app to remind users what the steps are to certain procedurez. Procedurez allows you to create, or import / export steps of procedures that you wish to remember. Steps have names, details and maybe even children (i.e., substeps). With a colorful interface and Swipe to Mark Complete functionality, figuring out how to do a process months / years later is a breeze.

## Installation
The following features might help you install this software:
- Written in Xcode 7.1.1
- Universal app
- Deployment Target 8.4
- CoreData.framework library

## API
Procedurez uses the API from parse.com for importing data from online. 

It uses a JSON format such as the following:

`{"title":"IBOutlets", "details":"How to create Storyboard objects and connect them to view controllers", "position":0, "sectionIdentifier":"Do", "steps": 
[{"title":"Click On Storyboard", "details":"", "position":0, "sectionIdentifier":"Do", "steps": []}]}`

## Collaboration
If you wish to create a procedure and have it added to the parse.com data so all can share in your thoughtfulness, just follow these steps:
- Export your procedure according to the How to Use This App steps.
- Select how to share it, via Email or Notes, then Email.
- Add Procedurez (at least) to the Subject Line of the Email.
- Send it to ransomkb@yahoo.com.

It will be evaluated and vetted for form and safety. If it passes muster, it will be added to the parse.com data for all to share in.
